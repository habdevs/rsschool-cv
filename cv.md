## Code Example

### KATA from CODEWARS: Complete the method/function so that it converts dash/underscore delimited words into camel casing. The first word within the output should be capitalized only if the original word was capitalized (known as Upper Camel Case, also often referred to as Pascal case).

#### Examples

"the-stealth-warrior" gets converted to "theStealthWarrior"
"The_Stealth_Warrior" gets converted to "TheStealthWarrior"

```

function toCamelCase(str){
  return str
        .split(/[- _]/) // splits the string into an array ['the', 'stealth', 'warrior']
        .map(
            // uppercase the first letters of all array elements except the first
            // turns ['the', 'stealth', 'warrior'] into ['the', 'Stealth', 'Warrior']
            (word, index) =>
            index == 0 ? word : word[0].toUpperCase() + word.slice(1)
        )
        .join('')
}
toCamelCase("the-stealth-warrior")
toCamelCase("The_Stealth_Warrior")

```

Worked with Express.js, Next.js, React.js, Node.js, TS, MongoDB, GraphQL, Apollo, Restful APIs... since 2021, practicing skills in freelance and training projects both from scratch and refining current legacy.

### Interests and hobbies

I like to learn new things, make the machine work, so to speak, animate the written code user interfaces. At school I tried to write console programs in java, in my free time I mostly read psychology and business-oriented books, and lately I've been reading specialized literature about JavaScript.
